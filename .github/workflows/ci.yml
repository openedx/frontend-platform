      # this is a temporary "hack" to unblock CI/releases, as ideally we should avoid needing to pin NPM to a specific verison minor version. by doing
      # so, we are basically just deferring clean up of peer dependencies for a later time. it also introduces confusion that engineers will have to keep
      # their local NPM versions in sync with CI, which can be a nuisance.
